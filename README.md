# Ask me Anything!

I am getting many emails/Twitter DMs and most of the answers could benefit a more general audience. So let's make them public. Ask away! 

_Anything_? **Anything!** Code. Cooking. Parenting. Life. Career. 

There are only two rules:
1. Be polite and civil;
2. DRQ (Don't Repeat Questions). 

### 🖐️ [Ask a question](../../discussions/new)
