# Ask me Anything!

![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed-raw/rlouf/ama?label=Answered)

I am getting many emails/Twitter DMs and most of the answers could benefit a more general audience. So let's make them public. Ask away! 

_Anything_? **Anything!** Code. Cooking. Parenting. Life. Career. 

There are only two rules:
1. Be polite and civil;
2. DRQ (Don't Repeat Questions). 

~~ [Read questions](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed) ~~  
~~ [Ask a question](../../issues/new) ~~
